* load-my-favorite-file-- a function that when called loads up your favorite (hard-coded) file. for example, your .emacs file.
  (find-file "~/.emacs.d/init.el")
  (load-file "~/.emacs.d/init.el")
* cycle-special-files	a function that when called repeatedly, cycles through a list of your favorite files (e.g. .aliases, weeklystatus, trackerlist)

* count-string-matches--return the number of occurrences of STRING in the buffer following the point
* reload-dot-emacs--prompt to save .emacs file (if necessary) and load the file
(defun reload-dot-emacs ()
  "reload .emacs file"
  (when (y-or-n-p "Would you like to save .emacs file first?")
    (when (bufferp "init.el") (save-buffer "init.el"))
  (load-file "~/.emacs.d/init.el"))
(reload-dot-emacs)


* strip-trailing-whitespace
	delete whitespace at end of lines in the entire buffer
* insert-code-template
	-- a function that inserts a template into the current buffer
	e.g. a template of a header file, or a .cpp file, or a perl file  
	-- bonus points for providing a mechanism for making it general enough to use so that it will work differently based on the appropriate mode and/or file extension
	-- hints : the variable 'major-mode, association lists
	-- more bonus points, hook it up so that this function is automatically called when a new (empty) file is opened
* insert-checkin-template
	-- a function that prompts you for the various fields for a check-in request, giving useful defaults
bonus points for properly indenting the list of files
* string-replace
	-- take three string arguments, replace all occurrences of the first by the second in the third string. Return the newly created string.


* write a function to:
pX reverse a string
** write a program to compute the nth fibonacci number
p* print out the grade school multiplication table up to 12x12
pX write a function that sums up integers from a file, one int per line
pX write function to print the odd numbers from 1 to 99
** find the largest int value in an array 
** Format an RGB value (three 1-byte numbers) as a 6-digit hexadecimal string.
